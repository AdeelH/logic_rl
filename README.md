## Using Temporal Logic in Reinforcement Learning
We explore two possible applications of Temporal Logic (TL) to Reinforcement Learning (RL): TL-based controller verification and TL-based rewards. We conduct some experiments applying these ideas to RL problems and discuss where they may work better than the traditional RL approaches. 

### Requirements
This project uses [py-metric-temporal-logic](https://github.com/mvcisback/py-metric-temporal-logic). 
```
$ pip install metric-temporal-logic
```
